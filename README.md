# Sketch&Stitch
The main purpose of this application is to create smart textiles from a sketch on fabric. The application allows users to snap/upload a colored sketch. It then separates the sketch into a number of files, each containing the lines of a single color. It can smooth the lines using an outline or centerline options. The application allows the user to determine which colors should be stitched with conductive yarn, and which should be stitched with regular yarn. An accompanying software communicates with embroidery machine software to convert each colored file into an embroidery pattern. Users may use Circuitry Stickers, custom stickers that can be added to a sketch to represent physical electrical components and custom stitch patterns, such as wire crossings and 2D matrix sensors.

This application was part of a research project published at ACM CHI 2018.
